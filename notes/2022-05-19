[ ] Sonic can run correctly on walls and ceiling
[ ] Sonic Can't pass thru walls
    [x] wall sensors are seen
    [x] wall sensors detect walls
    [ ] wall sensors distance will be less when on flat ground, greater when on not flat ground
    [ ] wall sensor will set ground speed to 0
[ ] PVSs can be closed (circular)
[ ] PVSs can move
[ ] Entities can have an X patrol
    - They patrol along the X axis from a start to finish on loop
[ ] Can set Line Segments in PVSs to be one-way collision
    - Can set collision from TOP, BOTTOM, RIGHT, LEFT
[ ] Can make a loop that has invisible gates that will change the collisions on loop so sonic can pass thru    
[ ] Add spring
[ ] Add horizontal lock on sonic
